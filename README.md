Day 1(02.11.2024):
I start with the first task. To begin with, I try to solve the problem using logic, without using code, and visualize using excalidraw. After that, I decide with the help of a code and make a submission.
Day 2(05.11.2024):
I did the second task, it was quite difficult not to come up with the metric itself and calculate, but rather write code that would correspond, it took a lot of time
Day 3(06.11.2024):
I finalized the second task, added print for all test cases. I also did the third task, at first I thought about a solution using trigonometry, but it seemed too difficult, so I decided in a simpler way.
